The finding include:<BR/>Resident #347's [DIAGNOSES REDACTED]. <BR/>The Resident Care Plan (RCP) dated 1/13/17 identified the resident with lung disease. Interventions directed to obtain pulse oximetry every shift and when needed, notify physician if oxygen saturation is below 90%, to administer oxygen as ordered and/or directed to observe for worsening Shortness of Breath (SOB), and to notify the physician of any unrelieved or new SOB at rest. <BR/>The 14 day Minimum Data Set (MDS) assessment dated [DATE] identified Resident #347 was noted with intact cognition, required extensive assistance with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and indicated the received oxygen therapy. <BR/>The physician's orders [REDACTED].<BR/>A podiatry consultation report dated 2/7/17 at 3:17 P.M. identified Resident # 347 was sent from the facility to the podiatry appointment with an empty oxygen tank. The resident's oxygen saturation level was at 90% (Normal Value greater than 95%).<BR/>The nurse's note dated 2/7/17 at 9:07 P.M. identified Resident # 347 was alert and oriented, had no acute respiratory distress and no glycemic issues. <BR/>The Grievance/Concern Report received 2/8/17 identified on 2/7/17 Resident # 347's portable oxygen tank was empty while the resident was at doctor's appointment. The Grievance/ Concern Report dated 2/8/17 further indicated the resident returned back to the facility after the appointment and her/his pulse oximetry was at 90%. The nurse directed the NA to bring the resident to her/his room and connect him/she to his/her concentrated oxygen tank. <BR/>The Reportable Event Form dated 2/16/17 identified Resident #347's family reported the resident went to a doctor's appointment without sufficient amount of oxygen which subsequently cause the resident to run out of oxygen. Additionally, the Reportable Event indicated that upon return to facility the resident asked for help with the oxygen but did not receive any assistance from the staff. <BR/>A review of clinical record and review of the facility investigation regarding the allegation of neglect lacked documentation to reflect the time the resident left the facility for the podiatry appointment, when the resident returned from the appointment and how many liters of oxygen Resident # 347 had in the oxygen. Facility documentation also failed to reflect the amount of oxygen the resident had in the tank prior to leaving the facility and/ or if the resident's portable oxygen tank had been checked prior to the appointment. <BR/>Further review of facility documentation records, Risk Management System (RMS) dated 2/13/17 reflected that the facility identified the family and Resident #347 concerns were identified as an alleged abuse and/or neglect. <BR/>A review of the facility investigation dated 2/13/17 identified the facility conducted their investigation 5 days after the family and /or the resident expressed a concern regarding an allegation of neglect.<BR/>Interview and review of facility documentation with Social Worker (SW #1) on 9/27/17 at 11:00 [NAME]M. identified on 2/13/17 she/he conducted a follow up interview with Resident # 347. However (SW #1 ) 9/27/17 at 11:00 [NAME]M. identified the interview date was incorrect because the resident was discharge from the facility on 2/10/17). SW # 1 further indicated Resident # 347 reported she/he left the facility for a doctor's appointment and the portable oxygen tank run out of oxygen while in the doctor's office. The resident also indicated the doctor placed him/her on a concentrator in the office and noted his/her oxygen saturation at about 90%. The resident returned to the facility with the oxygen saturation at 90 percent attempted to get the attention of the nurses but was unsuccessful because the nurses did not looked up at him/her. The resident finally got the attention of the nurse, who then checked her/his oxygen saturation which read 90%. The resident verbalized that she/he felt out of breath. The nurse directed a NA to assist the resident into the room at which time the NA changed the resident to the concentrator and assisted the resident into her/his bed.<BR/>Interview with (previous) ADNS #2 on 9/27/17 at 12:45 P.M. identified she/he was notified of the family and Resident #347 concerns on 2/13/17 when the facility received a letter from Person #2. ADNS #2 indicated that during the interview process for the allegation of neglect she/he was unaware that she/he had interviewed nursing staff from another unit not the unit the resident lived on at the time of the incident. The ADNS also indicated not all staff members who may have had possible knowledge of the alleged neglect were interviewed. <BR/>Review of facility Abuse Prohibition directed to report allegations involving neglect, exploitation or mistreatment and misappropriation of resident property within 24 hours, if the event does not result in serious bodily injury. The policy further directs staff to conduct a thorough investigation, to include documentation of witnessed interview and to document in the facility computerized medical record.<BR/>\""]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":481}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Uz5rCniwXWjP"},"source":["# Remove html tags\n","def remove_html_tags(text):\n","    text = text.apply(lambda x: BeautifulSoup(x, 'html.parser').get_text())\n","    return text"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZBr24MGTXbrf","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1606776706668,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7192,"user":{"displayName":"朱小语","photoUrl":"","userId":"09734155774406830279"}},"outputId":"51e2439d-151c-4462-de19-668a27163dc1"},"source":["inspection_report ['inspection_text'] = remove_html_tags(inspection_report ['inspection_text'])\n","inspection_report ['inspection_text'].head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0    Based on clinical record review, review of fac...\n","1    Based on observations and interviews, the faci...\n","2    Based on observations, review of facility docu...\n","3    Based on clinical record reviews, review of fa...\n","4    Based on clinical record review of facility do...\n","Name: inspection_text, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":483}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"n-5KDRVpXvlo"},"source":["# Remove unique symbols\n","def remove_symbol(text):\n","  res = ''\n","  text = text.split(' ')\n","  for word in text:\n","    word = re.sub('[@#<>]*', '', word)\n","    if '*' in word:\n","      continue\n","    if word != '':\n","      res += word\n","      res += ' '\n","  return res.strip()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"svhCqAlIYMKu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1607058658427,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":275485,"user":{"displayName":"朱小语","photoUrl":"","userId":"09734155774406830279"}},"outputId":"ae41cb42-cf73-4102-fde7-0e2d522e1d66"},"source":["inspection_report ['inspection_text'] = inspection_report ['inspection_text'].apply(lambda x: remove_symbol(x))\n","inspection_report ['inspection_text'].head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  \"\"\"Entry point for launching an IPython kernel.\n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0    Based on clinical record review, review of fac...\n","1    A large reddish brown area was also noted on f...\n","2    Based on observations, review of facility docu...\n","3    Based on clinical record reviews, review of fa...\n","4    The quarterly MDS assessment dated [DATE] iden...\n","Name: inspection_text, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":107}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Z13B6xd6F3Fq"},"source":["### Summarize data"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PPjA4By9cUSJ"},"source":["# TextTank\n","# Tokenizing the text \n","def summery(text):\n","  stopWords = set(stopwords.words(\"english\")) \n","  words = word_tokenize(text) \n","    \n","  #
